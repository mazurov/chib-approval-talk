\begin{frame}{Systematic uncertainties --- Polarization}


\begin{itemize}
\item The $\Upsilon$ polarization is expected to be small. 
``Measurement of the \Y1S,\ Y2S and \Y3S polarizations in  $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=7$ TeV'', \arxiv{1209.2922}.
\item The uncertainty related to the unknown polarization of \chib~mesons was estimated using
the prescription described in the LHCb paper ``Measurement of the relative rate of prompt $\chi_{c0}$, $\chi_{c1}$ and $\chi_{c2}$ production at $\sqrt{s}=7$TeV'' (thanks to Edwige Tournefier) that is based on the analytical calculations in HERA
``Production of the Charmonium States $\chi_{c1}$ and $\chi_{c2}$ in Proton Nucleus Interactions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 41.6-GeV''
\end{itemize}

\begin{block}{}
In the previous study the uncertainty due to polarization is dominated~$\approx 20\%$. This study shows that this uncertanty is less than~$9\%$.
