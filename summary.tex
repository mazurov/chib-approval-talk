\begin{frame}{Summary}

\begin{itemize}
\item Measured fractions of \Y1,2,3S originated from \chib decays.
About 40\% of $\Upsilon$ come from $\chi_b$, with mild dependence on $\Upsilon$ transverse momentum.
\item \textcolor{red}{The measurement of \Y3S fraction in radiative \chibThreeP
decay was performed for the first time.}
\item This analysis improves significantly the statistical precision of the previous work and 
adds more decays and transverse momentum regions.
% \item  The \lhcb detector design allows to perform measurements in $\Upsilon$ rapidity and 
% transverse momentum regions, which are complementary to the ones exploited 
% by \atlas and \cms.
\item Measured mass of $\chi_b(3P)$ is $10{,510}\pm2\stat\pm6\stat\mevcc$, consistent with another determination which uses converted photons.
\end{itemize}

% The results on \chib production were regularly presented at the LHCb bottomonium working group,
% an internal document was prepared by the author, is currently under review and will form 
% the basis of a future LHCb publication.
