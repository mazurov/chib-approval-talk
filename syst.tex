\begin{frame}{Systematic uncertainties}
\scriptsize
\begin{itemize}
\item Since this analysis measures the fraction of $\Upsilon(nS)$ particles
originating from $\chi_b$ decays, most systematic uncertainties cancel in the
ratio and only residual effects need to be taken into account.
\item Systematic uncertainties on the event yields are mostly
due to the fit model of $\Upsilon$ and $\chi_b$ invariant masses, while the
ones on the efficiency are due to the photon reconstruction and the unknown
initial polarization of $\chi_b$ and $\Upsilon$ particles.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item The uncertainty related to the  $\Upsilon$ fit model estimated by the previous study ``Production of $J/\psi$ and $\Upsilon$ mesons in $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 8$ TeV'', \arxiv{1304.6977}
\item Systematic due to photon reconstruction taken from the previous works based on
``Study of $\pi^0/\gamma$ reconstruction efficiency with 2011 data'', LHCb-INT-2012-001.
